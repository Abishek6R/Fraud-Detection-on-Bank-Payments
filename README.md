# Fraud-Detection-on-Bank-Payments
This repository implements a fraud detection system combining rule-based engines and machine learning. Targeting e-commerce, healthcare, and banking, it addresses the billion-dollar fraud issue. By merging rules with adaptive ML models, the system enhances accuracy and minimizes false positives.

This repository contains a kernel focused on detecting fraud in bank payment data using various classification techniques. We have achieved remarkable results with our classifiers by addressing the challenges posed by imbalanced datasets.

Key Techniques Used
Oversampling with SMOTE: To tackle the imbalance in the dataset, we applied the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to generate new examples of the minority class, enhancing the performance of our classifiers.

Results
While I havenâ€™t included the classification results without SMOTE in this kernel, you can find them in my GitHub repository for comparison.
